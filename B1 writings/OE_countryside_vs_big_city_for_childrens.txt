                            OPINION ESSAY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many people think that childrens should grow up in the countryside, while others
think the best option is that they grow up in a big city. I think that childrens
should grow up in the countryside for the next reasons.

Firstly, living in the countryside is better for children due to the pollution levels,
in the big city the air is dirtier than in the countryside and there is more 
pollution. The countryside is healthy for childrens.

Secondly, the big city is noisier than the countryside, this is a fact that 
can affect to the childrens rest and it would be very stressful for them and
for parents.

In conclusion, I preffer that childrens grow up in the countryside because is
healthier than the big city.

✅ Corrected Version of Your Essay (Model Answer):
Many people believe that children should grow up in the countryside, while others think it is better for them to grow up in a big city. In my opinion, children should live in the countryside for the following reasons.

Firstly, the countryside has lower levels of pollution. In big cities, the air is dirtier and there is more traffic and noise. The countryside offers a healthier environment for children.

Secondly, the countryside is quieter and less stressful. Big cities are noisy and crowded, which can affect children’s rest and increase stress for both them and their parents.

In conclusion, I prefer that children grow up in the countryside because it is cleaner, quieter and better for their health.
