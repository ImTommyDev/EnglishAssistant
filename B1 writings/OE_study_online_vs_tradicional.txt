            Is it better to study online or in a traditional classroom?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            OPINION ESSAY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nowadays many people choose to study online, they think it is more confortable,
while others prefer the traditional way. In my honest opinion the traditional
way is the best option for the following reasons.

Firstly, study in a traditional classroom is the best option to avoid distractions,
this is because you are in a more relaxed environment, when you study online at home
or another place there are a lot of distractions, for example, your mother calls you
or enters the room.

Secondly, study in a tradicional classroom allows you to ask questions easier than
in a online class because you are in the same room than the teacher and you just have
to raise a hand and ask.

In conclusion, study in a tradicional classroom is the best option to establish knowledge
thanks to avoid distractions and resolve questions.

✅ Corrected Version of Your Essay (Model Answer)
Nowadays, many people choose to study online because they believe it is more comfortable, while others prefer the traditional way. In my opinion, studying in a traditional classroom is the best option for the following reasons.

Firstly, attending a face-to-face class helps avoid distractions. When you study at home, there can be interruptions, such as family members calling you or entering the room. A classroom offers a more focused environment.

Secondly, in a traditional classroom, it is easier to ask questions and get help. You are in the same room as the teacher, so you can raise your hand and receive an answer immediately.

In conclusion, I believe that learning in a traditional classroom is better because it helps students concentrate and makes it easier to communicate with the teacher.
